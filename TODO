Server Side Rendering Problems:

- Back-End apparently would need to use ES6 modules instead of CommonJS imports.
- This branch has changed imports and exports to the ES6 syntax, but for some reason the app wouldn't compile
- Package.json option "type": "module" has been put into place, but that didn't help for the app to compile
