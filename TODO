Nginx reverse proxy:

-Make a reverse proxy conf also to demo.janetta.fi

CI/CD pipeline:

-Use cypress Docker image to test application (should the app also run in a container!?, maybe docker compose?)
-Optimize resource usage:
    *don't delete node 10 image on every pipeline run
    *can dependencies be ready in the pipeline (no need to npm install cypress, other front-end packages?)
-On successfull pipeline run:
    *delete unnecessary docker resources
-Include cypress tests in the pipeline
-Remove Node.js and PM2 from AWS EC2 server once the Docker pipeline works correctly. Update the prod-environment.md document accordingly.
