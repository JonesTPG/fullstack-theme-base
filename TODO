Application backend:

-Separate the websocket server to a separate route eg. localhost:4000/subscriptions.
 This way the nginx proxy can be set up to a single url route.

    *different env variable files -> done
    *Node test SSL server -> done
    *Create secure websocket server -> done
    *Change the subscriptions URL -> done
    *Test websocket server with react app -> done

Nginx reverse proxy:

-Make a reverse proxy conf also to demo.janetta.fi
-Make a reverse proxy for websocket connections
-Redirect all requests to https once the websocket connection is secure

CI/CD pipeline:

-Include the application build process (npm run build:ui in front-end folder) so that the Docker image will have the latest front-end code.-> done
-Optimize resource usage:
    *don't delete node 10 image on every pipeline run
-On successfull pipeline run:
    *delete unnecessary docker resources
-Include cypress tests in the pipeline
-Remove Node.js and PM2 from AWS EC2 server once the Docker pipeline works correctly. Update the prod-environment.md document accordingly.
