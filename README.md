## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project were the following:

- Become proficient with the modern technology stack (React.js, Apollo GraphQL, MongoDB, React Material etc.)
- Learn to develop web applications as a team
- Use DevOps practices (such as automated testing and CI / CD) to make the development work more efficient

## Project Outcomes

We learned a ton about developing software as a team and along the way took some big steps towards professional and efficient workflow. For example, we began to use Jira and Confluence to plan out our work. Also we learned the importance of planning when it comes to implementing some new features.

As an important outcome we also used this application template to take part to a LUTes Start-Up competition [Forward](https://lutes.fi/forward/). The competition continues throughout the spring of 2020.

Another important outcome of this project is that we got a good reference out of this that we can use when searching for jobs and other interesting opportunities.
